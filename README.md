Overview: 'Terrier Trivia' is an Android Studio application that is directed for Boston University students. It is a quiz app that allows our fellow Terriers to have a fun time time learning about our university. There are four levels of difficulty (freshmen, sophomore, junior and senior) and an 'ALL' option that the player can choose from before starting the quiz. Each of the four levels has 25 questions and the 'ALL' option has all of the 100 questions. Depending on the level of difficulty, the player gets a certain amount of points per question and they can only get three questions wrong before the trivia game ends. Once the trivia is over, the player can either return back to the main page to start a new game or post their username and score to the leaderboard website.
